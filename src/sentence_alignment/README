# Sentence Aligment using LASER by facebook_research

## Background

This folder stores the modules and scripts to perform sentence alignment using LASER encoded sentences and basic one-to-alignment.   
The encoded and basic output data is stored in `data/sentence_align_output` and `data/simple_align_output` respectively.

## File Structure

```
src/sentence_alignment/
├── LASER                     # LASER module from Facebook Research

├── file_handler.py           # script to deal with various reading and writing of .txt's & .csv's
├── laser_config.py           # script to config Laser module, download available encoders & tokeniser
├── sentence_alignment.py     # script to perform alignment for both encoded and plaintext sentences 
├── sentence_embedding.py     # script to perform encoding and decoding of extracted data in data/processed
└── sentence_tokenisation.py  # script to perform cleaning & tokenisation of extracted data in data/processed
```

## Overview of logic used

In `main.py`, the general steps to perform the SA task are as follows:
1.  Config LASER using the config script
2.  Build a big filepath dictonary to ref all the data easily  
    2.1   Throughout embedding and tokenisation the file structure of the raw data is kept intact to maintain links between the data
3. Embed the data in data/processed and write to data/embed
4. Tokenise the data in data/processed and write to data/tokenised
5. Perform sentence alignment using the embeddings and write to csv in data/sentence_align_output
6. Perform basic sentence alignment using one to one alignment of tokenised sentences and write to csv in data/simple_align_output
